Structure of Sound Files

Sounds are split into different categories.
For some categories there are subfolders for Wakingworld and Dreamworld, in the filename there will be WW or DW to further differentiate.

Other sounds like SFX and Voices can be used in both worlds and are therefore not further categorised.



Atmos: Just basic noise Ambiance backgrounds to set the mood.

Soundscapes: Musical Pieces that can play at different places and have way more movement and characteristics than the atmos.

SFX: One shot samples, split into different subfolders for things like Menu interactions, Character - World Interactions, Object Sounds.

Voice: Voices of NPC's lel
